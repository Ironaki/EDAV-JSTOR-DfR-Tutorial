Woolf’s first diary entry for the year records another row with her cook, Nelly Boxall, whose spirited defiance Woolf recognises as partly her own doing – the ‘fruit’ of the Bloomsbury group’s progressive, egalitarian politics and notoriously easy-going domestic arrangements (Woolf 1977–84: 3: 3). The spat with her servant forms a timely coda to Woolf’s famous assertion, in ‘Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown’ (1924), that ‘on or about December</p>

The decade began, of course, with the worldwide depression that followed the US stockmarket crash in October 1929. As the Great Depression deepened, with a full 25 per cent of Americans unemployed and many more severely under-employed, homeless and hungry, it began to seem as if there was no end in sight to years of misery.

Second, 1956 was a year of political and cultural tumult and, for many, the play seemed to articulate feelings of enraged but helpless frustration over events that included Britain’s ‘Suez Crisis’ and the Soviet invasion of Hungary.</p>

                     <p>The launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik-1 on 4 October 1957 changed not only the history of twentieth-century technology, but also politics, philosophy and aesthetics. It marked the start of a space race between the two Cold-War superpowers, with satellites put into orbit and the first humans, Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov in 1961, and John Glenn in 1962, undertaking orbital flights. Satellites and cosmonauts sent back photographs of Earth taken from space that enabled humankind, for the first time in history, to look at its planet as a whole. This new perspective galvanised the public as the planet’s beauty,</p>

                     <p>On 1 March 1979, the Labour Government of the United Kingdom held a referendum in Scotland on proposals to establish a devolved Scottish parliament that would take responsibility for those local issues which, since the Union of Scotland and England in 1707, had been the responsibility of the Westminster parliament in London. The proposals were the Labour Party’s response to the success, since the late 1960s, of the Scottish National Party, which campaigned for the dissolution of the Union and the re-establishment of an independent Scottish state. The referendum outcome, however, was indecisive: although a small majority voted in favour,</p>

Not retrospective, in the way that Ralph Waldo Emerson thought of nineteenth-century culture: nobody is looking back to the classics and few look even to literature of the recent past as standards for measuring new creativity. What our age does, rather, is splice, graft and recombine the materials left lying around after the disintegration of the old orders.
