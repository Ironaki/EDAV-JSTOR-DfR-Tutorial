         <p>
            <italic>The Tale of Genji</italic>, written one thousand years ago, is a masterpiece of Japanese literature, is often regarded as the best prose fiction in the language. Read, commented on, and reimagined by poets, scholars, dramatists, artists, and novelists, the tale has left a legacy as rich and reflective as the work itself.</p>
         <p>This sourcebook is the most comprehensive record of the reception of<italic>The Tale of Genji</italic>to date. It presents a range of landmark texts relating to the work during its first millennium, almost all of which are translated into English for the first time. An introduction prefaces each set of documents, situating them within the tradition of Japanese literature and cultural history. These texts provide a fascinating glimpse into Japanese views of literature, poetry, imperial politics, and the place of art and women in society. Selections include an imagined conversation among court ladies gossiping about their favorite characters and scenes in<italic>Genji</italic>; learned exegetical commentary; a vigorous debate over the morality of<italic>Genji</italic>; and an impassioned defense of<italic>Genji</italic>'s ability to enhance Japan's standing among the twentieth century's community of nations. Taken together, these documents reflect Japan's fraught history with vernacular texts, particularly those written by women.</p>

                        <italic>The Tale of Genji</italic>, written in the early eleventh century by a woman known as Murasaki Shikibu, has become a world classic and is still regarded as Japan’s finest work of literature. Since the early twentieth century,<italic>The Tale of Genji</italic>has been called the world’s first novel, giving us distinctive and memorable characters, realistic settings, and a deep interior view of the life of the nobility, particularly that of women of the middle ranks, in the heyday of Heian court society. The tale, which eventually grew to the fifty-four chapters that we have now, attracted notice from Murasaki Shikibu’s</p>

                     <p>“Criticism,” one eminent critic writes, “is in effect—or should be—what happens when people get excited about works of art and want to share that excitement with others.”¹ The texts in this chapter are the earliest known discussions of<italic>The Tale of Genji</italic>. They are also, in the most literal sense, exactly the sort of “criticism as conversation” described here as ideal. They are the record of people (probably women) who are excited about<italic>The Tale of Genji</italic>and are sharing their excitement with one another.</p>

A<italic>kuyō</italic>is a dedicatory service in which the merit acquired in preparing for and performing the rite is assigned to another person, usually deceased, in order to diminish that person’s suffering and speed his or her progress toward Buddhahood. The title<italic>Genji kuyō</italic>was applied to various such rites performed on behalf of Murasaki Shikibu, her readers, her hero the Shining Genji, and even<italic>The Tale of Genji</italic>itself.</p>
