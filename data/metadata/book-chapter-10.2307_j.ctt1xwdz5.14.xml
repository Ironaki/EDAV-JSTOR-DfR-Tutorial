         <p>This book compares production and consumption of Asian horror cinemas in different national contexts and their multidirectional dialogues with Hollywood and neighboring Asian cultures. Individual essays highlight common themes including technology, digital media, adolescent audience sensibilities, transnational co-productions, pan-Asian marketing techniques, and variations on good vs. evil evident in many Asian horror films. Contributors include Kevin Heffernan, Adam Knee, Chi-Yun Shin, Chika Kinoshita, Robert Cagle, Emilie Yeh Yueh-yu, Neda Ng Hei-tung, Hyun-suk Seo, Kyung Hyun Kim, and Robert Hyland.</p>

As the case of contemporary J-horror films exemplifies, the new, digitalized, multimedia form of cinema is now a dispersed phenomenon, both ubiquitous and transnational as technology, yet regional in the economic, industrial, and cultural contingencies of its</p>

Indeed, the film’s substantial success across Asia, as well as subsequent global distribution and an adaptation by Hollywood, suggest that in some way it managed to tap into themes with strong resonances both regionally and internationally.

                     <p>Horror, or ghost film, has a long standing in Hong Kong cinema. Since the 1970s, the film industry in Hong Kong has steadily churned out horror/ghost films for audiences in the region and horror has become a staple in Hong Kong cinema.¹ We can identify at least two narrative prototypes in Hong Kong horror. The first is called the ghost erotica, referring to romances between female spirits and male scholars. Based on the well-known Chinese classic <italic>Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio</italic> (Liaozhai zhiyi) written by Pu Songling in the seventeenth century, this type of story delineates the return of</p>

                     <p>In recent critical scholarship of Asian cinema and in Asian cinema fandom, much attention has been devoted to the phenomenon colloquially known as Asia Extreme cinema. While most can identify a film which is considered to qualify as “Asia Extreme,” little has been done to create a system of genre classification. The general categorization is that if a film originates from Asia and looks extreme, then it must be exemplary of Asia Extreme. Yet, as Carolus Linnaeus argued in the eighteenth century, in order for something to be accurately studied, it must first be classified.</p>
