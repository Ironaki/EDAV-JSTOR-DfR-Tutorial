      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>This sourcebook contains more than 160 documents and writings that reflect the development of Taiwanese literature from the early modern period to the twenty-first century. Selections include seminal essays in literary debates, polemics, and other landmark events; interviews, diaries, and letters by major authors; critical and retrospective essays by influential writers, editors, and scholars; transcripts of historical speeches and conferences; literary-society manifestos and inaugural journal prefaces; and governmental policy pronouncements that have significantly influenced Taiwanese literature.</p>
         <p>These texts illuminate Asia's experience with modernization, colonialism, and postcolonialism; the character of Taiwan's Cold War and post--Cold War cultural production; gender and environmental issues; indigenous movements; and the changes and challenges of the digital revolution. Taiwan's complex history with Dutch, Spanish, and Japanese colonization; strategic geopolitical position vis-à-vis China, Japan, and the United States; and status as a hub for the East-bound circulation of technological and popular-culture trends make the nation an excellent case study for a richer understanding of East Asian and modern global relations.</p>

                     <p>Over the last fifteen years or so, editors of this volume have been approached by colleagues in various disciplines—literature, history, anthropology, and film, cultural, and media studies—seeking background information as they try to incorporate Taiwanese literature into their college-level courses. There are, moreover, unmistakable signs of growing recognition in the field of East Asian studies of the interconnectedness of cultural developments across the region and of important issues that have not been adequately addressed by existing scholarship, which tends to focus on national cultures and, in most cases, specifically on the cultural traditions of the more powerful political</p>

An island of singular peaks in the midst of a vast ocean, it is permeated with an air of profundity and magnificence. Where there is a concentration of divine spirituality, there are bound to be men of elegance and refinement. Besides, in recent years [Taiwan] has benefited from the imperial policy of peace and edification; through ever-deeper immersion, it has been transformed by the Way. Every household is versed in music and poetry; people elevate themselves and contribute to the flourishing of literature and arts. Of the</p>

They are branches of coral reef. The ocean is so vast that it contains everything; the rarest treasures in the world are all found within. Why coral? Did not Du Fu say: “On the wind the Royal Attendant rides / Literary brilliance like a coral branch”? To compare literature to coral is to confer high value on it and at the same time to suggest its difficulty. Difficulty lies in the [harvesting of coral] branches.</p>

                     <p>Poetry arises from emotion. In my youth, I was enamored of poetry; in adulthood, I wrote poems on many topics; now in old age, I have not stopped chanting poetry. I have no idea why I have sustained the passion for six decades. I used to think my life would be complete if I could travel around the country and express my feelings along the way like the poet Mr. Huang Wuye [1524–1590]. It is a pity, however, that I always threw up when I was aboard a ship. After exhausting myself by embarking on three voyages to take</p>

                     <p>When it comes to the meaning of literature, views differ, and there has been no consensus in China since antiquity. In Japan or Western countries, it has a variety of meanings too. Literary language in my country has a long history. The word “literary” (<italic>wen</italic>) contrasts with “martial” (<italic>wu</italic>); it is also the collective term for learning, as seen in this statement by Emperor Wen [187–226] of the Wei dynasty: “Literary writing is a grand enterprise of governing the world and a noble endeavor of lasting value.” To give a recent example, in Japan before 1885, the educational structure</p>

However, spoken words are inadequate for reaching into the past and the present and illuminating both. That is why writing comes into being. Writing replaces the mouth with the brush as the vehicle; it replaces the listening ear with the observing eye. Thus, spoken and written words complement one another and expand the horizon of world literature.</p>

                     <p>The fact that I promote vernacular writing does not mean I have conducted excellent studies on it; I have never done any at all. But I felt the urgency and, with this clumsy article of mine, want to call your attention to the matter. I hope that you will be motivated to engage in the research and promotion [of vernacular writing] in order to advance our culture. I went to China in June earlier this year and witnessed the popularization of the vernacular and its great benefits. It made me more convinced that it was necessary to promote vernacular writing.</p>

                     <p>Sir, what you say about vernacular writing being “too plain, too simple” is undeniably the case, but I find it hard to agree with you that it “lacks authority” and has “no artistic value.” Yes, classical Chinese is truly elegant and artistic, but it cannot reach people from all classes and is only for experts. Living in modern times, we cannot perpetuate [the status quo].</p>

                     <p>One very dark night, the sky was so profoundly black that it prevented the starlight from filtering down to Earth. The gloom was deeper even than what one may find many meters underground. The terrifying dark was unprecedented.</p>

                     <p>Why do we call this periodical “little gazette” instead of “big gazette”? The reason is none other than this. On Taiwan’s intellectual scene today, besides three daily newspapers, there are monthly, ten-day, and weekly newspapers. There are quite a few large news corporations. When we look at the contents of these newspapers, they are all grand discourses written in a grand style. Such is the company in which this gazette finds itself. Newly born, it may be small in organization, and its language may not be embellished. Truly, facing the giants, this small potato is distressed. Therefore, we do not</p>

                     <p>Spoken language requires written language. Written language is nothing but a direct record of spoken language. Why is Taiwanese an exception?

It is urgent for us to treat this disease of illiteracy. With that in mind, what medicine can we prescribe? Yes, indeed, mandatory education will treat the disease at its root, and the promotion of the vernacular will target its symptoms. Looking at the current situation of Taiwan, I think we have no choice but to treat the symptoms first, as in a case of emergency. I suggest that we expedite the unification of written and</p>

                     <p>Today, the so-called popular literature in Japan is works written for the common people who do not have a high level of education. This came about naturally based on the relation between literature and society—because literature is no longer the exclusive property of a special class. It would have no meaning if it did not express the hopes of society as a whole and of people’s lives. Therefore, literature must be close to the people, offering them entertainment and comfort, so they can realistically take stock of their nature, thought, and emotions. In order to cultivate the people’s interests</p>

                     <p>It is worth our attention to note that numerous poets and poetry societies have arisen in Taiwan in the past two decades. I remember when I was young and learning how to write poetry, the most famous poetry societies were Li, South, Ying, Bamboo, and Mount Luo. There were few other than these. But since then, we have seen poetry societies popping up everywhere. The trend is truly surprising. On the island there are now around one thousand poets and fifty or so poetry societies.</p>
                     <p>On the surface, the thriving of literature in Taiwan is unprecedented. Look at the three</p>

                     <p>Over the course of this year, there have appeared advocates of nativist literature and proposals to reform the Taiwanese vernacular. It has always been my plan [to advocate the same], but it is easy to talk about yet difficult to put it into practice. How so? Those who can talk may not be able to do it; Those who can do it may not want to do it. This is why Taiwanese literature has been in gradual decline. To advocate for nativist literature, we must sort out the native language first. As to how to sort it out, it is</p>

                     <p>Let us first reconsider the notion of nativist literature. And before any theoretical discussions, it is necessary that I explain concisely the meaning of nativist literature.</p>
                     <p>What was the initial incentive behind the promotion of nativist literature? By the end of the nineteenth century, urban literature naturally came into existence, as the city had become the center of cultural and political developments. The flourishing of urban literature coincided with the rapid growth of modern cities after the Industrial Revolution, and the middle class played a major role in it. As the cities developed in a concentrated manner, transportation and print</p>

If a work of Taiwanese literature describes the life of the Taiwanese but lacks nationalistic tendencies or local color, it cannot be considered nativist literature as we are advocating it. Literature of all kinds will appear if the lives the Taiwanese lead are the subject dealt with from different points of view. This has been discussed above, and there is no need to repeat it. Regardless of how much Japanese education the Taiwanese people receive or how well they write in Japanese, they have been treated differently since childhood in all areas of life; in writing about</p>

The fire of their contemplation occurs in the wilderness, where a sweet breeze blows and the yellow fruits of the sandalwood clack. Taiwan, where we live, is particularly favored by Nature to be the best place for this sort of poetic contemplation. The literature we create has the color of the banana, the music of the water buffalo, and the love songs of the native girls. The literature</p>

To the small number of poets on the island, who are precious like jewels, we should respond with a lonely smile. As beautiful as a woman’s skin, soft and tender, [these poems] seem to bring a new poetic feeling to the island’s literary scene. Like a madman facing a woman dressed in translucent nylon, her breasts faintly visible, he writes an article to express how he feels, while casting a seductive look at these poets.

                     <p>Culture is governed by cultural logic—it may be tense, slow, or stagnant. Cultural stagnation is without exception [the result of ] passivity in a dynamic era, which turns into a stage for the sad tune of degeneration and decadence. As a result, it paralyzes productive action and allows the conventional, received, escapist, skillful, and playful atmosphere to prevail in the social realm.</p>
                     <p>However, culture, by logic, cannot stay stagnant forever. As the atmosphere of degradation and decadence develops on the other side, inevitably, dissatisfaction gives rise to critical consciousness, which, once awakened, will throw a napalm bomb of reform.</p>

                     <p>Generally speaking, folk literature—folk songs, folktales, and myths—has been produced for as long as human beings have existed. Primitive people composed folk songs to praise nature, and created tales and myths to explain nature. The former are related to their emotional life, the latter to their rational life. Japan’s<italic>Records of Ancient Affairs</italic>, China’s<italic>The Book of Songs</italic>, and the Greek myths are all expressions of primitive peoples’ views on art and philosophy, as well as on life and the universe.

                     <p>. . . A work of literature is, at root, the manifestation of the author’s thoughts and feelings. The only purpose of structure and description is to make as vivid and lively as possible the expression of these thoughts and feelings (the subject matter). Therefore, one should choose material on the basis of its effectiveness in bringing the subject matter to life. The structure of a story should serve to bring the subject matter to life. All description of the physical world and characters’ psychology should have a close connection to the subject matter too. We must be absolutely clear</p>

                     <p>Somehow, over the past two or three years, Taiwan’s once-disorganized literary world has gradually begun to take shape, an example of which is the founding of the Taiwan Literary Arts Alliance and the publication of<italic>Taiwan Literary Arts</italic>, as well as the fact that ordinary citizens have also begun to care about these happenings. The significance of these events is, in my view, historic and shows great progress.

Last year, when<italic>World Knowledge</italic>serialized translations of fiction from small and weak nations, I was reminded of Korea and Taiwan in the east, and thought that now would be the right time to introduce their literary works to readers. On account of that, I translated “The Newspaper Boy” [by Yang Kui] and sent in the manuscript. I never imagined how much it would move readers and delight friends. So I went ahead and translated “Mountain Spirit,” and at the same time got the idea to collect materials</p>

I have asked people from that era a number of questions about those activities. They say the first new drama movement was launched at the beginning of 1925 in the prefecture of Taizhong, at a place called Wufeng (today’s Wufeng Village in Datun District), by several local people who formed an organization called the Yanfeng Drama Troupe to study modern drama.

                     <p>It is often said that literature is a hobby, but we must ask ourselves: Can literature as hobby exist after all? I don’t think so. It is impossible to experience life in literature, even though the spirit of literature does permeate our life. If this were not the case, literature would not have come into existence. This matter pertains more to writers from the periphery—especially writers from a special locale like Taiwan—than to those at the center. Despite painful fetal movements, the literary circle in Taiwan is yet to be born, because of internal problems and a lack</p>

                     <p>. . . For Taiwanese culture, 1940 was a memorable year. In a retrospective I wrote for a journal, I said that 1940 was “a year when what went off track got back on track and in order, showing a semblance of literary expression.” Previously, writers carried on in their own way, like solitary walkers who roamed as they pleased. Now writers have suddenly become closer; united, they have formed an organization.</p>

                     <p>My country has occupied Taiwan for forty-six years now. Based on a survey of the literature produced during this time, I have reached the conclusion that it should be divided into three periods. My judgment is based on the following criteria: (1) the depth of Japan’s interest in Taiwan, (2) the educational level of people in Taiwan, (3) the general reader’s attitude toward things literary and artistic, (4) the platform for literary works and the caliber of readers, and (5) the qualities of the authors themselves. According to these criteria, the first period spans from Japanese occupation of Taiwan in</p>

                     <p>NAKAMURA: People often voice the criticism that there is no critical spirit in Taiwan. However, it seems that there is neither a critical spirit, nor a spirit of being critiqued. In other words, there is no good criticism.</p>
                     <p>LONG: I guess one reason is that there are no true critics. The same is true of Japan. Compared with authors, critics receive little recognition for their work and therefore a low income. I think this is also a reason. In Japan, Mr. Aono Kikitsu is probably the only person who can make a living as a critic. In</p>

                     <p>Some time at a Wednesday meeting, the topic of Izumi Kyôka [1873–1939] was brought up. I listened as Matsukaze Shigeru expressed his opinion that Izumi Kyôka is one of Japan’s great writers who brought Japanese tradition back to life, and he is correctly placed in literary history alongside Koda Rohan [1867– 1947]. I completely agreed with him, but I was surprised that almost all of the people present that day agreed with Matsukaze’s view. Although I find it amusing that the Wednesday gathering was really a Kyôka meeting, I wonder if these days Kyôka is not read in a</p>

                     <p>According to the law, there are times when lying is permitted; however, within the confines of literature, lying is not permitted. When authors lie in their works, even for [the purpose of artistic] development, for people who love truth and the truth value of literature, works that use lies are not worth a penny. Every immortal work is the revelation of the author’s soul. For example, Flaubert declares: “Madame Bovary, c’est moi!” And at the end of<italic>War and Peace</italic>, Tolstoy provides an eloquent discussion on history. There are no exceptions. For example, [Nagai] Kafû states: “Since I am extremely</p>

                     <p>. . . If it is natural to pay compliments to good writing, it also seems reasonable to criticize bad writing. For example, although Ye Shitao’s “An Open Letter to Mr. Shiwai Min” is not poorly written, there are parts that I find unacceptable. I don’t know Mr. Shiwai Min personally. I have read some of his works, but they did not leave much of an impression on me. Even so, this has nothing to do with my criticism of “An Open Letter.” Besides, even the Society of Imperial Subjects for Patriotic Services is actively directing the literary movement.¹ It</p>

                     <p>The war has formally entered the final stage. Even at this precise moment, as I speak, fierce and bloody battles on the bases in the South Pacific are raging on in the form of hand-to-hand combat.</p>
                     <p>The great result of the battle in the Solomon Sea made our blood boil; yet the enemy’s stubborn but doomed resistance is surely going on. Even though we may suffer twists and turns in a certain region or at a certain time, we must persist with our unyielding conviction of ultimate victory, and advance with a clear and bright spirit on the road to</p>

                     <p>The beginning of Taiwanese literature goes back twenty some years during the period of Japanese imperialist rule, when World War I had just ended and the high tide of national self-determination was spreading throughout the world. The considerable influence and stimulation generated from the tide naturally shaped the Taiwan New Literature movement. The influence of the May Fourth movement cannot be discounted either. Thus, while we sought plain, populist forms of expression, ideologically we prized anti-imperialism, antifeudalism, democracy, and science. The first voices speaking on behalf of this movement arose from<italic>Taiwan Youth</italic>, founded by overseas students studying in Tokyo.</p>

                     <p>Q: Is it logical to speak of “Taiwanese literature”?</p>
                     <p>A: Yes, the term is not only logical but necessary.</p>
                     <p>Q: Educated people here have recently started active discussions on “constructing a new Taiwanese literature.” According to Qian Gechuan, this topic is flawed. What are your thoughts on this?</p>
                     <p>A: There is nothing wrong with it.</p>
                     <p>Q: That being so, Qian Gechuan says that literature is identified by region, such as southern European literature and northern European literature, because ethnic groups differ in their essence, spoken and written language, and ideas about lifestyle, which exert an influence on the way they</p>

Countless patriotic writers have fully developed their intelligence and skills by penning works with flesh and blood that sing and cry. The contribution to our fellow soldiers and citizens engaged in combat makes us take pleasure in the fact that the Chinese renaissance is following fast on the national restoration in opening up an infinitely glorious horizon.</p>

Since the most important sentiment that humankind has is feelings for the people, nationalist literature is the best tool through which to communicate feelings for the people. And since nationalist sentiments derive from nationalist thought and consciousness, nationalist literature is also the best tool with which to communicate nationalist thought. Today, in our effort to oppose the Communists and resist the Soviets, the most important thing is to inspire the hearts and minds of the people so that they will be unified, and</p>

We base our affiliation on similar views of New Poetry and consistent literary tendencies.

The Modernist School is a poetry group and not a social organization. Other than adherence to the tenets of the Modernist School, members of this group are completely free to join, or not join, any literary organization</p>

                     <p>There is no telling how many budding writers have dreamed of writing a great work since the literary revolution in China began. The standard of a great book is this: it reflects a great age. For this reason, the public places this expectation on writers, and writers also place this expectation on themselves. It seems that if the background of a novel doesn’t encompass thousands of miles and characters, if it doesn’t involve such scenes as wars, flights to refuge, demonstrations, riots, the building of canals and roads, and so on, then it has not accomplished its mission.</p>

                     <p>This past March, I had the unexpected pleasure of corresponding with Mr. Liao Qingxiu [b. 1927] and reflecting on how young Taiwanese writers are situated in the contemporary Chinese literary scene. I came to realize that, few in number, we should stay in close contact in order to learn from one another and reach new artistic heights. It is undeniable that the success of any enterprise depends on individual resolution and perseverance. However, the encouragement and support of friends is also an important factor. Why should the literary enterprise be any different? In the history of human achievement, there are</p>

We often wonder, we always wonder, when can we publish a poetry journal that has good size, quality, and impact? This is not a dream, but cruel reality tells me: How can you break free of the many difficulties, each the size of Iceland? It is only today, when I have the courage to look out the window at the sun of a spring morning, that my heart is filled with mixed feelings—sour and sweet, bitter and spicy.</p>

Her essay starts by bemoaning the fact that much nonsense is being written in England that attacks modern poets for having lost touch with the reading public.¹ Sitwell expressed her dissatisfaction with such excessively critical articles. She went on to clarify the true significance of modern poetry and the key to understanding it. Modern poetry has received harsh criticism not only in England but also in the United States.

Although we have never hoisted the banner of modernism, we are in truth the eyewitnesses and practitioners of modern art. We do not advocate modernism due to objective circumstances. Besides, modernism embraces many schools and we are not content with confining ourselves to any one of them. We do not belong to any school; we are only on a quest of the spirit [of modernism].

Well versed in classical Chinese literature and masterful in their use of the Chinese language, they were able to assimilate and negotiate with those resources and accomplish a great deal. Zhu Ziqing [1898–1948] and Xu Zhimo [1897–1931] boasted an abundance of extremely well-crafted lines, and they also wrote superb prose. Therefore, even though they searched for the new, they did not end up sounding ridiculous. Li Jinfa inherited European symbolism and was bent on</p>

                     <p>This past June, during a meeting of the Provincial Assembly, an assemblyman called on the government to give more encouragement to native Taiwanese writers, and on newspapers and magazines to print more of their works. Governor Zhou Zhirou [1899–1986] made an impromptu reply: since Retrocession [in 1945], Taiwanese writers have made an exceptional showing and won the respect of their compatriots in their hometowns. He cited three names as evidence: Lin Haiyin, Shi Cuifeng [b. 1925], and Liao Qingxiu.</p>

It was hampered and gradually sank into chaos, however, after the League of Left-Wing Writers was founded in Wuhan. Many poets were swept off their feet by the political wind. They became obsessed and tried to use thinly poetic verses to strike the revolutionary gong. They lauded themselves as a proletarian “wild flower and arrow” (Hu Feng), “son of a rural village” (Qing Bo), “political worker</p>

A second was that in these last few years we were all fired and driven by our passion for literature.

When they realize that the image in the mirror is not real but imaginary, out of anger and sadness they shatter the mirror and set out to find a truer, more complete self cast in another mirror. The process of the creation of modern art takes the form of this tragic circle. From imagism to cubism, Dadaism, surrealism, and on down to existentialism, each movement and school of thought shatters one fantasy, only to construct a new</p>

I remember that eight years ago you sat next to me at a meeting that the Writers Association held in the Recovery Room at Dr. Sun Yat-sen Hall. We chatted about the past in Xi’an, and you asked me to critique your work. At the time, I had only praise for it; there was nothing for me to critique. However, I did feel uncomfortable about the length of your hair, mainly because I thought it was an inconvenience; moreover, long hair didn’t suit a writer. When I asked</p>

It includes primarily short lyrical pieces, humorous pieces, travelogues, biographical sketches, prefaces, book reviews, and so forth.

Although her children, Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science, have gradually grown up, and although her third child, vernacular writing, has been alive for more than forty years, May Fourth herself is dead. At the very least, amid the sounds of the golden bugle and silver drums of modern literature and art, she is dead, and has been dead for years—pale May Fourth, suffering from serious heart disease.

                     <p>It is clear now that May Fourth no longer holds any significance for us. We can regard it as a thing of the past, just like the Tang and Song dynasties. We dare make this claim because poetry now is unlike anything that has come before. Through painful revision, even negation, of its past, poetry has entered an insular era, but an era that discloses the vital creativity of the young generation. Put quite simply: this generation finally has its own poetry. It is time to celebrate. Enough said.</p>

                     <p>. . . In works like “Carefree Wandering” and “Dreary Rain,” I genuinely wished to forge in the smithy of the Chinese written language a tablet of immortality. In these sorts of works, I attempted to compress, flatten, stretch, and sharpen Chinese, to dismantle it before putting it back together, to rend it and fold it, in order to test its velocity, density, and elasticity. My ideal is to allow the Chinese written language, as it undergoes syntactical changes, to form an orchestra, with every character following the writer’s brush like the conductor’s baton in a symphony.

                     <p>For years I have been critical of literary modernism. Having attended several showings of<italic>Waiting for Godot</italic>put on by<italic>Theater</italic>magazine, now I can reexamine my long-standing views. I have corrected some of my misapprehensions about modernism on the one hand, and on the other hand, have come to feel that modernism is about to make a new departure—particularly literary modernism here at home.</p>
                     <p>Literature reflects its era. Indeed, a particular historical era and its social conditions produce literary works of a particular nature and content. It is quite natural that this era and this society we call</p>

                     <p>Collected in this book are the short stories I wrote during my junior year at NTU. I had started to write in middle school. However, my earlier works, which included modern poetry, essays, and short stories, not only were ornate in language and immature in content but also suffered from an even bigger flaw: they were too sentimental. This flaw,<italic>sentimentalism</italic>in English, is a common, and the most intolerable, shortcoming among Chinese writers. Therefore, I was reluctant to include those early works in this collection.</p>

In the midst of it, I stepped out of my office on an errand and left the open book on my desk.

When we reflect on the history of modern poetry over these two decades, we recognize many problems on the one hand, but, on the other hand, from a historical point of view we realize that the development and transformation of modern poetry represents the most challenging phenomenon in recent literary history.</p>

Today in the West, the novel enjoys the same distinction throughout the scholarly world as do poetry and drama, and it is an object of study by scholars and critics alike. But this distinction did not come lightly. On the contrary, the trials and challenges were considerable. Throughout the past century the novel sustained numerous attacks and even lawsuits before ascending the ranks of the literary world to acquire legitimacy. Flaubert’s<italic>Madame Bovary</italic>was the object of a lawsuit, while Thomas Hardy’s</p>

                     <p>. . . Literature on Taiwan today is an inadequate reflection of the age. It lacks social consciousness; at least this is the case with most writers. We can divide commonly seen works into two categories: the remote and the introspective. The remote gives outlet to homesickness [for the mainland], while the introspective seems to weave dreams. True, dreams and homesickness can be excellent material for literature, but what gets left out between the two? What is left out is life in the present. . . .</p>

Its owner was a young boy of about ten. He was squatting on the ground and using his hand like a rattle-drum, repeatedly flipping it back and forth, back and forth. After standing there for a while, I finally heard the tinkle of a few coins dropping into his lunch box. When I left town, the sound of the rattle-drum followed me quietly on my journey.</p>

This is a point I make in several speeches that I have given at universities. But if we use May Fourth as a periodizing concept, it only has meaning in terms of time. We could just as easily say “since the founding of the Republic” or “since Cao Xueqin’s time.” When we refer to May Fourth, it is more than chronology. Just as<italic>New Youth</italic>disavowed and tried to destroy the Chinese theater, traditional literature, and other aspects</p>

Referring to both the earlier generation and the current crop of writers, I argued that for intellectuals who fled the turmoil of war and landed in Taiwan and other places abroad, the endless sufferings they endured—the cauldron of war, heartbreaking exile, destruction of country and family, and other historical calamities—have converged to form an incomparably powerful and stark, yet rich and concentrated, sustenance for living.

                     <p>Even as the debates over the nature of New Poetry have raged on over the past fifty or more years, poets have never lost sight of their enthusiasm and aspirations for poetry. They have worked to the best of their abilities and left a rich legacy. With China now divided, massively split in time and space, people shudder in fear and desolation.

Fortunately, Free Taiwan is the center of the</p>

She studied at Mount Holyoke College and later at Johns Hopkins University, where she majored in English literature and received a master’s degree.

                     <p>Taiwan is situated in the typhoon belt of the subtropical zone. The surging Japan Current circulates through the ocean on all sides. Consequently, rain is plentiful, the four seasons are summer-like, and vegetation is lush and verdant. No wonder the Portuguese sailors who navigated the Taiwan Strait on their way to Japan cried out with admiration: “Illa! Formosa!” [Island! Beautiful!] Taiwan has been called Formosa by Westerners ever since. The unsurpassable natural beauty and the subtropical climate have certainly exerted a profound influence on the people who have lived on this land for generations and have molded their unique dispositions:</p>

                     <p>Recently I had the pleasure of reading “Introduction to the<italic>History of Nativist Literature in Taiwan</italic>,” a powerful piece by Mr. Ye Shitao. I feel deeply that this fine essay is outstanding among the contributions of the past two years, one the likes of which I have not seen since the 1950s, and one that uses new historical science to discuss literature.</p>
                     <p>In this essay, Mr. Ye points out that Taiwan has its own special characteristics due to its geography, history, and spiritual life; yet at the same time it has the general character of China. Mr. Ye also finds</p>

                     <p>. . . Since the beginning of the year I have read several articles on literature. I believe that some contain incorrect, even harmful, analysis and discussion and are in need of clarification. Under the premise of patriotism and love of literature, literary enthusiasts share the responsibility of overcoming small differences in pursuit of common ground, debunking fallacies, and expounding valid reasoning.</p>
                     <p>In their surface meanings, “realist literature” and “nativist literature” may not sound problematic. The issue is, we cannot be deluded by these names and neglect to analyze their contents and underlying theories.</p>

                     <p>In Taiwan, the term<italic>xiangtu wenxue</italic>has a somewhat different meaning from that prevalent in most other countries. While logic suggests that the term denotes literature that focuses on life in the countryside, in Taiwan<italic>xiangtu wenxue</italic>also includes portrayals of city life. The primary requirement is that the work be realistic in nature. Given this fact, it would be helpful to first take a look at the development of realism itself. The movement known as realism began in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when writers in the West sought to depart from romanticism in pursuit of freedom in writing</p>

                     <p>Although the love of the native land is a magnificent tradition in Chinese literature, even in world literature, in the past year [1977–1978], Chinese literature written in Taiwan about love of homeland has been subjected to false accusations never before encountered. The kind of muckraking described below has appeared in newspapers and magazines nearly every few days. There is a small group of wolves in men’s clothing in our literary circles. In the name of nativist literature, they peddle the poison of elitist literature. They fight tooth and nail the motto of<italic>gong-nong-bing</italic>literature.

                     <p>According to my observations, the essay as a literary genre enjoys singular prominence in the Chinese tradition. Western literature comprises mainly poetry, drama, and fiction. True, throughout its history, some essays were distinguished by structural integrity and artistic flourishes. In view of their outstanding art and intellectual appeal, they may constitute a genre. However, in the West, the conditions that qualify the essay, whether long or short, as literature are uneven and weak. To use English literature as an example, intellectual appeal typically has to do with the author’s cogent reasoning; precise observations on literature and art, in particular, make</p>

                     <p>It is obvious that the phrase “Chinese literature in Taiwan” was used widely in the debate on nativist literature. If one were to push such a term to the extreme, then Taiwan would appear as a frontier region and Taiwanese literature a “frontier literature.” Such a concept naturally became the center of controversy.</p>
                     <p>Zhan Hongzhi’s essay, “Two Types of Literary Mind,” sparked exactly such a polemic. . . . Zhan’s pessimistic views seem to expand on the literary theories of Chen Yingzhen. That is to say, Taiwanese literature is a branch of Chinese literature. China is the geographical center, and</p>

                     <p>At the end of the 1960s, when Taiwan’s young intellectuals loved to base their thoughts and opinions on existentialism and psychoanalysis, Li Ang was beginning to write fiction. At that time, she adamantly believed that she was trapped in an impossible situation. Besides enduring the difficulty of growing up, she was up against the most boring and yet important choice: the college entrance exam. To her, the choice was between continuing to tolerate the trivial and tedious life in a small village with boundless patience, and going to Taipei, which she imagined to be a world filled with Camus’ strangers.</p>

I write with only the kind of ballpoint pen to which I am accustomed. I can write only at my own desk, only after one in the morning, and only after drinking two cups of coffee. I am extremely sensitive to certain things: the texture and hue of the paper, the thickness of the pen point, the fluidity with which it touches the paper, the brightness of the lamplight, the color of the table. .</p>

                     <p>The Silver Bell Society was active for six or seven years, from 1943 to 1949, which coincided with the defeat of Japan and the return of Taiwan to China. The level of political turmoil and economic collapse in this period had seldom been seen in the history of Taiwan. Yet during those trying years, a group of young people worked diligently and without compromise to create literature. Because of them, this period in Taiwan’s literary history is not a void. Looking back today, we ought to recognize their unique significance.</p>

                     <p>After the brutal persecutions in early 1947, a long period of anguish and oppression shrouded Taiwan until the end of 1979, when a widespread and incisive reaction to the unjust rule arose. The chain of events and bloodshed that followed radically transformed popular sentiment and thinking in Taiwan. Like a river of blood, the Zhongli Incident [1977], the Formosa Incident [1979], [the 1981 murder of] Chen Wencheng [1950–1981], [the 1980 murder of the family of ] Lin Yixiong [b. 1941], and an untold number of unjust imprisonments passed before our very eyes, and the public bore witness to these</p>

                     <p>. . . These sixty-some years of my life straddle two completely different periods. From childhood through early adolescence, I was educated and grew up under the giant shadow of Japan’s fascist militarism. Moreover, I completed my limited high school education under imperialistic rule and to the sounds of the fifes and drums of the Pacific War. What’s more, I also served as a second-class imperial soldier. After Japan was defeated, I retired as a first-class soldier, thanks to the Potsdam Declaration. So my life until age twenty was no different from that of Japanese men in their sixties today.</p>

                     <p>In the past few years, all of the plays I have had a part in creating went straight to stage performances first and were then followed with written scripts. This may seem strange. It is commonly assumed that a theatrical work begins with a playwright who has written a script, and then the production company finds a director and a designer, selects a cast, and conducts rehearsals. Finally, the play is presented on stage by the cast of actors.</p>
                     <p>This is the traditional method, which is efficient and scientific. It’s not for me to criticize the method, for I have</p>

                     <p>QUESTION 1: Members of New Land are all writers and scholars. Why don’t they devote themselves to creative writing and research, instead of expending their efforts on founding a publishing house that specializes in literary works from mainland China?</p>
                     <p>ANSWER: The group of friends that founded New Land entered the field because they love literature. None among them consider themselves famous writers or scholars, even less do they care about external glory. On the contrary, as they gain experience and knowledge, they recognize that the world of Chinese literature is borderless, and they become even more vigilant. . . .</p>

                     <p>The roots of the little theater are still shallow. Only a couple of dozen little theater troupes exist, and their audience is probably only one-thousandth that of television. Yet the impressive boom in the little theater has made it the most energetic part of Taipei’s cultural scene. “Trends are changing with changing times.” As Taiwan’s politics, economy, society, and culture face a moment of crisis, the little theater—tiny though it may be—is poised to play a vanguard role.</p>
                     <p>Why? Because the artistic medium of the little theater has the greatest potential to meld with the unstoppable social forces</p>

                     <p>The term “heteroglossia” has its origin in the lexicon of the Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin [1895–1975] and signifies the inevitable constraints, differentiation, contradictions, revisions, innovations, and other phenomena occurring in the process of using language and communicating meaning. On the one hand, these phenomena reveal the characteristics of written language evolving in the flux of time and changing space, while on the other, they mark language’s multiple reciprocal relationships with social and cultural structures. Refuting the premise of the linguistic concept of “monoglossia,” “heteroglossia” also makes us rethink the humanist categories of culture, history, and politics. It reminds us</p>

                     <p>After the Civil Associations Act became law [in 1989], any organization that originally had used the word “Taiwan” in its name was forced to change it before it could be officially registered. On the eve of the stipulated deadline for registration, the Ministry of the Interior rejected any application to establish an organization with a name containing the word “Taiwan” as inappropriate. This was the government’s way of officially renouncing Taiwan. When it came to the human rights movement, the environmental movement, and other movements in Taiwan, irrespective of their objective, focus, and impact, none could go beyond the bounds;</p>

                     <p>The great wheels of time have rumbled past the 1980s and ushered in a brand-new era—the 1990s. Having begun its course in the 1920s, Taiwanese literature is impacted by the turbulence of time as it enters an era that will in all likelihood be very different from those of the past. Just what kind of literature will Taiwanese literature of the 1990s be? Before we attempt to answer this question, it would seem even more important that we should ask first: What kind of literature is Taiwanese literature?</p>

                     <p>The development of modern poetry has always been a contested topic, so much so that one cannot help but feel that “if the poets don’t die, the thieves won’t quit.” But it is incontrovertible that the poets are still writing poetry, and new poets are rising up to replace the old ones. As we stride into the 1990s, we may as well revisit this topic.</p>
                     <p>If we say that there is some kind of predicament facing modern poetry, on the face of it, it must be the following issues.</p>
                     <p>1. Difficulty publishing poetry</p>
                     <p>2. Difficulty publishing poetry collections and difficulty</p>

                     <p>In the prefaces I have written previously, I simply introduced the author and the work. That is pretty much what I intend to do here, but nowadays it is no longer fashionable to say “introduce.” Nowadays you say “read.” A “reading” is a bit broader than an “introduction,” because you not only read the work, you also read the author. To go one step further, the reader himself or herself needs to be read too. By adding layer upon layer of reading, the reader constructs a complex hermeneutic framework. . . .</p>

How seriously true artists take their art. People like van Gogh, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Modigliani, Utrillo, Soutine, Dégas, and Munch, how madly they painted. Without that kind of perseverance, passion, resolve to cast off everything, and devotion to art above all else, how can one achieve anything? As a novelist, one has an even tougher path than a painter. Novelists cannot depend on pigments in the</p>

                     <p>In Taiwan, many government and public education agencies once provided housing for employees and their dependents. Gradually, these housing facilities developed their own unique style or set of characteristics. However, when people mention<italic>juancun</italic>[lit. “dependents’ village”], what they mean is the military family housing built by the government after it relocated to Taiwan. From Shimen in the north to Hengchun down south, they were built next to military bases. Numbering in the hundreds, they were collectively called “New Villages” and were given names based on branches of the armed services and political slogans. These densely situated, humble houses harbored</p>

                     <p>Chinese poetry, which is to say, poetry that uses the Chinese script as its medium of expression, has a long and venerable history. Modern-style poetry in Taiwan, on the other hand, had its inception only in the 1920s and is less than a century old. Nonetheless, a wide variety of poetic styles have emerged at historical junctures as a result of numerous internal and external factors. First, there was the bitter and defiant verse in the latter part of the Japanese occupation period, then the subdued and desolate in the early postwar period, followed by forty years of ebb and</p>

                     <p>. . . One day in November of 1976, when I had just enrolled in the history department at National Taiwan University (NTU), I was attending a literature lecture (I don’t recall the precise title) at Tamkang University with several friends who were also literature lovers. Not long after the lecture began, we entered into an argument over the question of nativist literature with Li Yuanzhen and Li Shuangze, who were in the audience, which resulted in a street fight in which there were no casualties, only confusion.</p>

                     <p>After my novel<italic>Labyrinthine Garden</italic>was published in 1991, I became acutely aware that with the changes taking place, Taiwan’s liberalization was inevitable. When that happened, it would finally be possible to write political fiction.</p>
                     <p>During the four decades of the repressive White Terror and martial law era, writers were compelled to avoid real life in their works and to write only about the subjective inner world. Those who dared to get involved in current affairs suffered a predictable outcome—singing the “Green Island Nocturne.” Broaching this topic in fiction was even less feasible.</p>

                     <p>What really thrilled and enthralled me were the literary supplements to the newspapers. Open a newspaper and the literary supplement is displayed quietly before you. Run your eye over the entire page and it is like a garden filled with colorful flowers, all laid out before your eyes. It is such a wonderful feeling. A literary supplement need not be read</p>

The practice actually began in the late 1970s, when Ya Xian took the helm of the literary supplement to the<italic>United Daily.</italic>Before that, literary supplements tended to adopt a passive approach. Except for translations of reports from foreign news agencies, the supplements would decide whether or not to do an introduction (let alone a special report) based solely on the articles they could get.

                     <p>Based on my impression and experience, the character is often mispronounced as “bei,” “pai,” “bi,” or any other similar character. Actually, this character is pronounced “bai” in Mandarin. It appears in volume 13, chapter 7A of the dictionary<italic>Shuowen jiezi</italic>[Explaining and analyzing characters]. The compiler, Xu Shen [ca. 58–147], defines it simply as “a different kind of grain.” That means it belongs to the grain family but is different from those with which we are familiar.</p>

                     <p>In March 1999, when the new millennium was just around the corner, numerous retrospectives and reflections got underway, along with many planned celebratory activities. The Conference on the Taiwanese Literary Canon, organized by the<italic>United Daily</italic>literary supplement under the auspices of the Council of Cultural Affairs, took place on the 19th to the 21st at the National Library.</p>
                     <p>Roughly two months have elapsed from the date when the Taiwanese literary canon was announced at the conclusion of the conference. As many as eighty reports and reviews were published in print media. During the threeday conference, cable and noncable television</p>

The breadth of the vocabulary depends on the aesthetic intention governing the work.”¹ To put it another way, when it comes to writing, aesthetic intention takes precedence over the richness or paucity of vocabulary; the latter should be decided by the former,</p>

                     <p>Taiwanese people possess a divergent national consciousness due to the position of the nation. This has led to many debates in the world of Taiwanese literature over the last thirty years. The concept of what is “Taiwanese literature” and what is “Taiwanese language literature,” which ought to be so simple that one can figure it out using one’s knees, have nevertheless become problematic concerning the position of Taiwanese literature, authors, and content, as well as the written language employed. Postwar Taiwanese literature also has changed much and developed rapidly over the past thirty years. The appearance of Taiwanese language literature</p>

                     <p>The trajectory of the New Literature movement in Taiwan, which began in the 1920s, parallels that of the New Literature movement in China, which started in 1917. Both were influenced by international circumstances and domestic social changes in the late nineteenth century. As Tse-Tsung Chow observes in<italic>The May Fourth Movement: Intellectual Revolution in Modern China</italic>[1960], the movement used literature to overturn the morbid, old tradition and replace it with a new culture.</p>
                     <p>Another characteristic shared by the Taiwanese New Literature movement and the Chinese May Fourth movement is that they had to tackle the most important issue of</p>

                     <p>It is generally believed that nature writing in contemporary Taiwan has evolved since the 1980s.

The genre and scope of my works have rarely strayed from mountains, rivers, and other natural subjects. Because most of my encounters are with bugs, fish, plants, and trees in the wild, as well as naturalists doing field studies, I’ve gotten in the habit of traveling all about and constantly transcribing my observations. Moreover, having been baptized in the waters of the environmental movement, everything I see and hear on this clod of earth called Taiwan provides literary nourishment that cannot be</p>

                     <p>zhu: . . . You have said in private that literary experimentation is a matter of give and take. For example, after submitting a piece that conforms to the reader’s expectations, your next piece will have room for experimentation. Can you say a little about what you tried to experiment with in<italic>Chaos Fan</italic>? wu: An artistic medium is not merely a tool for creation; the medium is also the object of creation. It’s impossible for me to feel comfortable with preexisting forms and only pursue content. In this work, I turned things upside-down and then turned them upside-down again.</p>

                     <p>Most likely I will never see those strangers again. It is just a one-time meeting, nothing like sworn sisterhood. There is no need to give a full introduction. I usually just say: “How do you do?”</p>
                     <p>That’s all. But sometimes they ask questions. Perhaps intrigued by my friend’s bragging, I get excited. Generally speaking, if a friend introduces me as Mrs. Lin, foreigners are not interested in asking any questions. If my friend says I am a</p>

                     <p>SUN: It is a rare opportunity to talk about your creative work and indigenous literature in the cradle of contemporary Taiwanese literature, Stars Café. We know that since the 1980s, as indigenous subjectivity developed, some young people entered the world of writing one by one. From a certain standpoint, the so-called indigenous literature written in modern Chinese has developed for fifteen years. Today I would like to look at your creative work and place it in the context of indigenous literature on the one hand, and to talk about your work and thinking in the context of Taiwanese literature, or</p>
