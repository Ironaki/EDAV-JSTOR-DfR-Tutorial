                  <p>Dr. Christopher C. Harmon Dr. Harmon has long-held interests in the two subjects of this text: strategy and terrorism. His first book, coedited with low intensity conflict expert David Tucker, was Statecraft and Power (University Press of America, 1994), a work in honor of a teacher of strategy, Harold W. Rood. Harmon taught on the Strategy &amp; Policy faculty of the Naval War College, Newport, RI, and then wrote and directed a strategy syllabus for 200 Marine majors, foreign allies, and US civilians at Command &amp; Staff College, Quantico Virginia, where he later held Marine Corps University's Kim T. Adamson Chair of Insurgency and Terrorism (2005–2007). He is the author of two editions of the graduate-level textbook Terrorism Today—published by Frank Cass (2000) and Routledge (2007), as well as chapters on terrorism and counterterrorism for Fanaticism and Conflict in the Modern Age (2005) and The American Military Tradition (2007). Two of Dr. Harmon's articles have appeared in the journal Vital Speeches. The US State Department gave him a Distinguished Public Service Award. From March 2008 through September 2009, Dr. Harmon was executive director as well as curricula chief of the Marshall Center's Program on Terrorism &amp; Security Studies; he is now Director of Studies.</p>
