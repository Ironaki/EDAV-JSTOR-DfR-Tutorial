      <abstract abstract-type="short">
         <p>The recent transnational reach of Japanese television dramas in East and Southeast Asia is unprecedented, and not simply in terms of the range and scale of diffusion, but also of the intense sympathy many young Asians feel toward the characters in Japanese dramas, so that they cope with their own modern lives by emulating the lives on screen. Through the empirical analysis of how Japanese youth dramas are (re)produced, circulated, regulated, and consumed in East and Southeast Asia, each chapter in this volume variously explores the ways in which intra-Asian cultural flows highlight cultural resonance and asymmetry in the region under the decentering processes of globalization. Key questions include: What is the nature of Japanese cultural power and influence in the region and how is it historically overdetermined? How is it similar to and different from "Americanization" and other Asian cultural sub-centers? What kinds of images and sense of intimacy and distance are perceived through the reception of Japanese youth dramas?</p>

                     <p>In the latter decades of the twentieth century, the drastic development of communication technologies and the concurrent emergence of global media corporations have facilitated the simultaneous transnational circulation of information, images, and texts on a global scale. Various (national) media markets have been penetrated and integrated by the powerful missionaries of global consumer culture such as News Corp., Disney and Sony. However, cultural globalization does not just mean the spread of the same products of Western (mostly American) origin all over the world through these media conglomerates.

                     <p>In the 1990s, the Japanese media industry grew rapidly, both in terms of the range of consumable media and the number of choices within these media products. Within this development of Japan’s information environment, there was a downward trend in the audience ratings television programs received, to the extent that the number of so-called “mega hit” programs that attained high ratings declined in numbers (See Tomura 1991; Ito and Fujita 1999). Due to the diversification of viewer lifestyles, tastes and interests, and, above all, to the multiplication of media products, the audience became segmented and fragmented.

                     <p>Following the 1991 broadcast in Taiwan of <italic>Tokyo Love Story,</italic> a Japanese television drama series commonly referred to as an idol drama, contemporary Japanese culture has come to be a dominant influence over Taiwan’s youth culture. Images of Japanese pop stars and singers were soon to crowd Taiwan’s television screens and record stores in the years that followed. Within a decade, the term <italic>ha-ri</italic> (Japan-mania or Japanese fever) has turned into an everyday word that indicates a formation of consumer culture: fashion, commodities, tourism, <italic>manga</italic> (comic books), magazines, and television shows.

                     <p>The tendency of popular culture forms to spread to areas within geo-cultural — rather than simply regional — markets is commonly attributed to what Straubhaar calls “cultural proximity.” Cultural proximity is the notion that cultural similarities, including “shared identity, gestures and non-verbal communication; what is considered funny or serious or even sacred; clothing styles; living patterns; climate influences and other relationships with the environment” are key elements in determining preference patterns of certain imported cultural forms over others (Straubhaar 1997, p. 291). With regard to the popularity of Japanese dramas in Asia, this notion is recalled in terms such as “shared sensibilities”</p>

As we move towards a new informationbased economy and digital technology, we begin to witness the magnitude of the flow of these cultural goods, which rise in conjunction with the multiple channels of distribution of large global media conglomerates.

Since the mid-1990s, VCDs have been widely marketed in most Asian countries, excluding Japan. Invented in 1993 and developed by a number of transnational electronics companies, including Sony, Panasonic, Philips, and Matsushita, etc., VCDs emerged in the Asian market earlier than the official release of DVDs in 1997 in the global</p>
